Stack: 
    A Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.

Stack Operations:
    1. Create
    2. Insert - top_insert(push)
    3. Traverse - print (LIFO)
    4. Delete - delete_top(pop)
    5. Peek - peek_top(return top_value)
    6. Check Empty

    1. Insert Operation:

        Time Complexity:
            Insertion at the top: O(1)
        Space Complexity:
            Insertion at the top: O(1)

    2. Delete Operation:

        Time Complexity:
            Deletion at the top: O(1)
        Space Complexity:
            Deletion at the top: O(1)

    3. Read(Peek) Operation:
        
        Time Complexity:
            Reading an element: O(1)
        Space Complexity:
            Reading an element: O(1)
